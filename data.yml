  info: 'Under French law, no legal text formally prohibits the payment of a ransom in the event of a ransomware attack. However, although the typology of attackers is very diversified and obscure, some attacks can be sponsored by terrorist organisations or by individuals designated on international sanction lists. Paying a ransom, or helping to pay it, to these groups, therefore, exposes the victim to potential criminal and administrative charges for the financing of terrorism or money laundering. Article 421-2-2 of the French Criminal Code punishes in particular the financing of terrorism, and as such provides that It is also an act of terrorism to finance a terrorist enterprise, by providing, collecting or managing any funds, securities or property or by giving advice for that purpose, with the intention of seeing such funds, securities or property used or with the knowledge that they are intended to be used, in whole or in part, for the purpose of committing any of the acts of terrorism provided in this chapter, regardless of the possible occurrence of such an act. When it comes to money laundering, article 324-1 of the FrenchCriminal Code also punishes the fact of facilitating, by any means, the false justification of the origin of properties or incomes of the perpetrator of a crime or of an offense having given him a direct or indirect profit. Committing these acts is liable to up to ten years imprisonment and fines of up to EUR 1,875,000 for companies [6]. Companies subject to the anti-money laundering and terrorism financing obligations provided for by the Monetary and Financial Code also incur administrative sanctions of a maximum amount of EUR 100m or 10% of their turnover [7].'
