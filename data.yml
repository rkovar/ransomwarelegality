  color: green
  info: Under French law, no legal text formally prohibits the payment of a ransom
    in the event of a ransomware attack. However, although the typology of attackers
    is very diversified and obscure, some attacks can be sponsored by terrorist organisations
    or by individuals designated on international sanction lists. Paying a ransom,
    or helping to pay it, to these groups, therefore, exposes the victim to potential
    criminal and administrative charges for the financing of terrorism or money laundering.
    Article 421-2-2 of the French Criminal Code punishes in particular the financing
    of terrorism, and as such provides that It is also an act of terrorism to finance
    a terrorist enterprise, by providing, collecting or managing any funds, securities
    or property or by giving advice for that purpose, with the intention of seeing
    such funds, securities or property used or with the knowledge that they are intended
    to be used, in whole or in part, for the purpose of committing any of the acts
    of terrorism provided in this chapter, regardless of the possible occurrence of
    such an act. When it comes to money laundering, article 324-1 of the FrenchCriminal
    Code also punishes the fact of facilitating, by any means, the false justification
    of the origin of properties or incomes of the perpetrator of a crime or of an
    offense having given him a direct or indirect profit. Committing these acts is
    liable to up to ten years imprisonment and fines of up to EUR 1,875,000 for companies
    [6]. Companies subject to the anti-money laundering and terrorism financing obligations
    provided for by the Monetary and Financial Code also incur administrative sanctions
    of a maximum amount of EUR 100m or 10% of their turnover [7].
