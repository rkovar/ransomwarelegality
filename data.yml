  info: While there are financial and ethical considerations at play, paying a ransom
    to a criminal is, generally speaking, not illegal in Canada. However, it is a
    crime to give financial aid to designated individuals and organizations that are
    deemed terrorists or otherwise on applicable sanctions lists or from embargoed
    countries. Entities considering paying a ransom should conduct due- diligence
    and contemporaneously document their findings in order to show that they undertook
    reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of the attackers. Most penalties for
    violating Canadian sanctions include knowledge qualifiers, so payors should be
    in a position to demonstrate the steps they took to ensure that a ransom payment
    did not violate such provisions. In the United States, OFAC released guidance
    on this issue, and Canadian organizations with ties to the US should be acutely
    aware of the risks and expectations.

  color: green
  info: Under French law, no legal text formally prohibits the payment of a ransom
    in the event of a ransomware attack. However, although the typology of attackers
    is very diversified and obscure, some attacks can be sponsored by terrorist organisations
    or by individuals designated on international sanction lists. Paying a ransom,
    or helping to pay it, to these groups, therefore, exposes the victim to potential
    criminal and administrative charges for the financing of terrorism or money laundering.
    Article 421-2-2 of the French Criminal Code punishes in particular the financing
    of terrorism, and as such provides that It is also an act of terrorism to finance
    a terrorist enterprise, by providing, collecting or managing any funds, securities
    or property or by giving advice for that purpose, with the intention of seeing
    such funds, securities or property used or with the knowledge that they are intended
    to be used, in whole or in part, for the purpose of committing any of the acts
    of terrorism provided in this chapter, regardless of the possible occurrence of
    such an act. When it comes to money laundering, article 324-1 of the FrenchCriminal
    Code also punishes the fact of facilitating, by any means, the false justification
    of the origin of properties or incomes of the perpetrator of a crime or of an
    offense having given him a direct or indirect profit. Committing these acts is
    liable to up to ten years imprisonment and fines of up to EUR 1,875,000 for companies
    [6]. Companies subject to the anti-money laundering and terrorism financing obligations
    provided for by the Monetary and Financial Code also incur administrative sanctions
    of a maximum amount of EUR 100m or 10% of their turnover [7].

    Much as in the United States, there is no blanket ban on ransom payments in the

    money laundering and sanction provisions. For instance, under s15(3) and s17 of
    the Terrorism Act 2000, a party will be liable for a ransomware payment if they
    knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that the funds would or may be used for

  info: Legally there is no prohibition from paying a ransom, but consideration should
    be given to whether such an entity or person to whom the ransom payment is being
    made is sanctioned or a terrorist group. In practice, the identity of the perpetrator
    might not be ascertainable thus it is important for businesses to conduct necessary
    risk assessments before making such payments and have regard to their data protection
    obligations to report data breaches to the relevant parties.
