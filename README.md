# ransomwarelegality
Can you pay the ransom in your country or state? That's the question I kept asking myself. Then I started making a list, and a couple of months later, I realized I wanted a map and a project with chatGPT. So that's how we got here. I wrote the whole website and scripts using chatGPT. If you see wrong or outdated data, please feel free to do a PR!
